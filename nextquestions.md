GOOD QUESTIONS:
- question18.c (arrays)


C concepts
- dynamic memory allocation for 2d arrays
- fgets,scanf, getc etc difference and when to use what

TODO: 
- question14.c (general), 
- question17.c (arrays), to be done after trees and linkedlist is done
- question19.c (arrays): to be done after trees is done
- question20.c (arrays): to be done after hashing (method 3)
