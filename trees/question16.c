/*
Print bottom view of a binary tree

Same method using double linked list will be applied here as done in previous question and question12.
Instead of chaining the elements using SLL we maintain only one node, and keep replacing it
if any other node comes up at that distance. Time and space complexity remains the same.

This cannot be done using min and max without space complexity method as done in question15
