/*
You are given an array "A" of "n" integers. It is given that the elements of "A" satisfy the following inequalities: 
   A[0] < A[1] < ... < A[m - 1] < A[m] > A[m + 1] > A[m + 2] > ... > A[n - 1] 
   for some (unknown) index "m" in the range [1,n-2]. 
   Let us call such an array a "hill-valued" array. The sequence A[0], A[1], ... , A[m - 1], A[m] 
   is called the "ascending part" of the hill, and the remaining part A[m], A[m+1], . . ., A[n - 1] is called the 
   "descending part" of the hill. The element A[m] is the "peak" of the hill and is the
   largest element in the array. Your task is to locate the peak, i.e., to determine the values of "m" and "A[m]". 
   Write a C function "int binarysearchpeak (int array[], int first_index, int last_index)" 
   to perform the task, by performing a (non-recursive) binary search. The initial call to the function is of the form 
   "m = binarysearchpeak(A, 0, n-1)" where "A" is a hill-valued array holding "n" integers. The function returns the 
   value of "m". Write a complete C program to demonstrate the working of the function. You might
   have a hard-coded hill-valued array of (say) 10 integers inside your "main()" body.
   Input: Nothing 
   Output : the value of "m" and the value of "A[m]", printed from inside "main()".          [3]
