/*
Longest non-overlapping repeating sub string

Total number of sub strings of a given string are n^2.
Now, once we have a given string, we need to see whether that substring is a part of the remaining string or
not. This can be done using KMP algorithm in O(n) time
Therefore total time complexity: O(n^3)

Better method:
